msgid ":ref:`Units` are official state or state-sanctioned organizations responsible for the internal or external security for a country, including the police, army, navy, air force and other security forces. Units refer to any any part of the hierarchy of a security force, ranging from a defense ministry with national jurisdiction, to a police unit based in a small town. Units can also be groupings of units such as \"operations\", \"joint task forces\" or peacekeeping missions. The Monitor collects data about a unit's name, aliases, bases and other physical infrastructure, geographical areas of operation and relationships with other units over time."

msgid ":ref:`Persons` are natural persons who are affiliated with, or hold positions of command over a specific unit at a particular point in time. The Monitor creates a dossier for each person, which includes their name, aliases, rank, title, role and the different units which they are affiliated with. In addition, we use a format called :ref:`Persons Extra` to capture data about a person's online and social media accounts, and media describing how a person looks and sounds"

msgid ":ref:`Incidents` are publicly-documented allegations of human rights violations committed by security forces. These include extrajudicial killings, rape, torture and other forms of violence. The Monitor does not make allegations itself, but rather complies allegations made by governmental bodies, human rights organizations and other civil society actors. For each incident, the Monitor includes a description from the source, date(s), specific location(s), its perpetrators and the types of human rights violation alleged to have happened."
