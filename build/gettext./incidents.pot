msgid "Incidents are publicly-documented allegations of acts committed by state-controlled security forces that may violate human rights laws and standards, international criminal law and other sets of relevant norms. Incidents may include extrajudicial killings, rape, torture and other forms of violence. Security Force Monitor does not make these allegations itself, but compiles allegations made by governmental bodies, human rights organizations and other civil society actors around the world."

msgid "The Security Force Monitor focuses its research on the structure, personnel and operations of security forces; we do not directly investigate specific allegations of human rights abuse in the way that Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch do. As such we consider all reports of human rights abuses as “alleged” in our documentation. This simply means these are claims that other organizations have made and which we are repeating without further verification. The Security Force Monitor does not make allegations against security forces and the data that we publish does not attempt to demonstrate involvement of individuals or units in human rights abuses beyond that which other organizations have alleged."

msgid "In a departure from how we compile data about :doc:`units` and :doc:`persons`, individual fields in incident records are not sourced and rated for confidence. Rather, we provide a single source for the entire incident. This is because each incident is a direct copy of material from a single source rather than a tapestry of material from a range of different sources."

The soldiers removed their robes, beat them, and marched them to their commander at the bridge. He described what happened next: The soldiers told us to lie down. Four of the soldiers opened fire on us. The commander was watching. I was lying on my side. They saw that some of us were moving and shot us again. I then lost consciousness. I regained consciousness in the night and dragged myself to an area in the dirt near Dandal Community Bank. I spent the night under a bus. In the morning an achaba [commercial motorcycle taxi] man who knew me took me to my house. My family called a doctor…. They removed four bullets from my body.

All the people who left the mosque were gathered together: the elderly and children were allowed to go home. The men were brought before a “pointer”, who pointed at him and 17 other men. He was first taken to a JTF station called NEPA and then to Giwa Barracks. “One by one we were brought in front of an armoured tank. I never saw anything. People said there was someone inside. When I went up, soldiers said I should go left. They started beating me. One soldier beat me with his gun and I fell down. They tied my hands behind my back and beat me. Then told me to go inside the car. I don't know why I was chosen. I was surprised, I don't know what I have done.” The military released Usman with 41 others in November 2014.

msgid "Unlike data captured about ``units`` or ``person``, data about ``incidents`` are not sourced at the level of each individual field. Instead, we have a single source for the whole incident. The entry in ``Incident: Source`` should be a Unique Identifier (\"UUID\") for a source access point that has been alreayd created in the master list of sources. The relevant values will be found in the field ``Source: Access Point Unique Identifier``."
