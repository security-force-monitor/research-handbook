msgid "In the Security Force Monitor (SFM) data model, Locations are a primary entity; this means we manage them as a discrete set of datapoints that can be referenced in other parts of the dataset. Locations are the way we describe the \"sites\" and \"areas of operation\" of :ref:`Units`. Locations describe the geographic footprint of security forces, including their infrastructure (bases, facilities, checkpoints, air fields, bunkers), as well as their territorial jurisdictions and operations as they change over time. We also use Locations to describe the places where security force units are alleged to have committed human rights abuses."

msgid "When we have decided on what Location is actually described in the source, we use the fields in this standard format to capture and structure data about the Location. We can do this by consulting existing sources of geospatial information like `OpenStreetMap <https://openstreetmap.org>`__, `Humanitarian Data Exchange <https://data.humdata.org/>`__, commercial mapping services like Google Maps, and (where they exist) data provided by the relevant national geospatial agencies. We reconcile the information we gain from the sources with options provided to us by a number of geospatial information sources, which we then turn into a Location."

msgid "For example. if a source describes a place called \"Potiskum\" in Yobe State, Nigeria we can `look it up on OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/255322295>`__. From this record, we can capture the Location's name, object ID number (``255322295``) and its geometry type ( a \"node\", which is a \"point\" for our purposes). We enter this basic data about the Location into the Location fieldset, generate a UUID for it (``41b3aec7-d88e-4ef1-a7d8-1b7fdf81a20c``), and create a \"human readable\" key that we can then use to reference this specific Location in other parts of the data model (``Potiskum (osm, point) 41b3aec7-d88e-4ef1-a7d8-1b7fdf81a20c``). We can then use SFM's ``geo`` automation tool to obtain more information from OpenStreetMap about this Location, including its geometry (in this case, a coordinate pair), additional metadata (such as a name in Arabic or other local languages), and the various adminstrative areas (like states, local government areas, wards) in which it is sited. This additional information enables us to plot the Location on a map, and opens up a whole range of opportunities for geospatial analysis."

msgid "Where there is not a good option in an existing geospatial data source, and where the source contains sufficient descriptive information, we can create the Location data directly using a Geographical Information System (GIS) tool like QGIS, Earth Pro or Google My Maps. This method is useful for describing Locations that may emerge from geolocation processes, such as views portrayed in images and other subjective descriptions of a place."

msgid "We create a datasets of Locations for each country we work on. These data are stored in a spreadsheet (or delimited text file like ``.csv`` or ``.tsv``) and a corresponding ``GeoJSON`` file that contains everything in the spreadsheet as well as every Location's geometry and any additional metadata about the Location provided by the geospatial information source. The two files provide views of the data that are useful for different purposes. The ``.tsv`` can be easily updated using a spreadsheet, but it's not the right place to store the geometry; the ``GeoJSON`` is more useful to developers and can be pulled in a geographica information system (GIS) for analysis and visualisation. We keep the two files synchronised. Storing the Location data this way also means we retain a standalone copy in robust and easily-processed formats of all the data we need."

msgid "The Location model described in this documentation replaces an earlier approach that stored the full metadata about a Location alongside the data on Units and Incidents. Maintaining the Location information using the earlier approach involved a great deal of duplication and introduced more opportunities for error. This updated approach brings the management of Location information into a single place and idiom, enables more effective use of automation tools, and extends the range of data we can capture and manage about Locations."

The reason for this particular formulation is the need to balance readability with uniqueness. We could choose to use the UUID in ``location:id:admin`` as a way to reference Locations in other tables, but this would not give any indication about where the Location was, or what sort of Location it was. Similarly, the values in ``location:name`` could be used as a reference to a Location, but these are not unique enough for us to be certain that we are referencing the correction Location.
