msgid "The data we create is carefully collected from a variety of publicly available sources, generally online, which include laws of the country, government media and press releases, reports from civil society groups, and local and international news reports and many others. We comb through these sources and use the information we find to populate a set of fields about persons, units and incidents, and the relationships between them. The resulting data is a synthesis of information provided within a tapestry of different sources - over 7,000 at the time of writing. We collect data on sources themselves, including their titles, date of publication, online location - the data model for sources is documented in the :doc:`sources` section of this handbook."

We'll now look at each in turn"

msgid "For example, records about units cover dimensions like the unit's basic identity (``Unit: Name``, ``Unit: Country``, ``Unit: Classification``), its relationships with other units (``Unit: Related Unit``, ``Unit: Membership``), its physical infrastructure (``Unit: Base Name``) and other dimensions.  Data on units are structured in standard formats of over 60 possible fields. We may use hundreds of different sources to create a record about a single unit: however, the sources used to evidence the existence of a unit's base or area of operations may be different from those we use to evidence its participation in a peacekeeping mission. Further, the sources that show when a unit entered a particular location may be different from those that show when it left."

msgid "To overcome this challenge, we state what sources are used for each and every data point. This gives us the advantage of being able to quickly audit a data point; it also means we can see all the data points evidenced by a specific source, or a specific part of the source. This point is important: sources can have multiple access points, which we create to show that we used material from a particular page number or archive version of a source. The :ref:`Sources and Access Points` section of this Research Handbook provides more detail on this important concept."

Sources for this type of information generally are laws of the country, government websites, and books. For example, if the law states that police force is divided into Police Divisions and Police Stations and a Monitor researcher comes across a source that references a particular Police Division, we would accept that source with ``Low`` confidence as this conforms with what other sources state about the structure of the police. Conversely, if a Monitor researcher came across a source that referenced a \"Police Command Zone\" they would need to do more research before publishing information on this potential unit, as \"Police Command Zone\" does not fit into what other sources state about the structure of the police. This could mean the other sources are incorrect, or that a change has occurred in the structure of the police force, or simply that this is a formation not referenced by the Monitor's other sources. Additional research would help clarify the situation."
