The content sidebar is a navigation aid. It provides quick links to different sections of the person record. The items inside the content sidebar indicate what sort of data is available about this person. If a particular section is not listed in the content sidebar - for example, "Subordinates" - then there is no data available about the subordinates of this person.

This section contains a table that describes the positions a person has held in different units. In this table, WhoWasInCommand will display a new membership row is displayed for each time a person changes unit, rank, role or title. This means that in some records a person may have multiple memberships in the same organization, but in different roles or at a different rank.

As with all tables in person, unit and incident records on WhoWasInCommand, hovering over or tapping any value in the table will cause a little coloured circle to appear. Clicking or tapping again on this will show the sources and confidence ratings we have assigned to that value.

The chain of command section displays interactive charts. These show the links between all the units commanded by a person and all those superior to them, along with their commanders. The chart will display up to the highest-level unit in the unital structure, creating a "line of sight" from the current unit to the top.

The charts are drawn using parent relationships between units that are classified as ``command`` (rather than ``informal`` or ``administrative``). You can learn more about this in the documentation for :ref:`Unit: Related Unit Classification`.

The charts are drawn at the last cited or end date of the parent relationship. This date is displayed at the bottom of the chart. Where a unit has different parents at different times, a chart is drawn for each relationship: swiping left or right, or using the arrows at each side, displays these.

Person record: Superiors
