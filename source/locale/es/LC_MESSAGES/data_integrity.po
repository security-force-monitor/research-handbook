"The data we create is carefully collected from a variety of publicly "
"available sources, generally online, which include laws of the country, "
"government media and press releases, reports from civil society groups, and "
"local and international news reports and many others. We comb through these "
"sources and use the information we find to populate a set of fields about "
"persons, units and incidents, and the relationships between them. The "
"resulting data is a synthesis of information provided within a tapestry of "
"different sources - over 7,000 at the time of writing. We collect data on "
"sources themselves, including their titles, date of publication, online "
"location - the data model for sources is documented in the :doc:`sources` "
"section of this handbook."

"As part of our data creation method, we have implemented four powerful "
"integrity measures that help ourselves and others users of the data "
"interrogate and assess its quality: data point level evidencing; data point "
"confidence scores; making data timebound; and, differentiation of unknown "
"and unnamed units in the command chain. We'll now look at each in turn"

"For example, records about units cover dimensions like the unit's basic "
"identity (``Unit: Name``, ``Unit: Country``, ``Unit: Classification``), its "
"relationships with other units (``Unit: Related Unit``, ``Unit: "
"Membership``), its physical infrastructure (``Unit: Base Name``) and other "
"dimensions.  Data on units are structured in standard formats of over 60 "
"possible fields. We may use hundreds of different sources to create a record"
" about a single unit: however, the sources used to evidence the existence of"
" a unit's base or area of operations may be different from those we use to "
"evidence its participation in a peacekeeping mission. Further, the sources "
"that show when a unit entered a particular location may be different from "
"those that show when it left."

"To overcome this challenge, we state what sources are used for each and "
"every data point. This gives us the advantage of being able to quickly audit"
" a data point; it also means we can see all the data points evidenced by a "
"specific source, or a specific part of the source. This point is important: "
"sources can have multiple access points, which we create to show that we "
"used material from a particular page number or archive version of a source. "
"The :ref:`Sources and Access Points` section of this Research Handbook "
"provides more detail on this important concept."

"Implementing this sytem in practice is challenging. For simple data capture "

"Police Divisions and Police Stations and a Monitor researcher comes across a"

"source with ``Low`` confidence as this conforms with what other sources "
"state about the structure of the police. Conversely, if a Monitor researcher"
" came across a source that referenced a \"Police Command Zone\" they would "
"need to do more research before publishing information on this potential "
"unit, as \"Police Command Zone\" does not fit into what other sources state "
