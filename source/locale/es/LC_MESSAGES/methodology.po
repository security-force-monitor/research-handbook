"Security Force Monitor researchers familiarize themselves with the country’s"

"levels of government (for example: local, regional, state, national) and "
"their connection to different security forces. In examining this we also "
"flag where there might be major changes in the structure of government, such"
" as those that may accompany a constitutional referendum or a peace process."

"“by hand” is possible, but would be slow and error prone. These high value "

"For example, the Monitor's scoping research on Nigeria revealed that by law "
"every state and the federal territory has a Police Command. By extension "
"this means since 1996 (when the last states of Nigeria were created) there "
"have been 37 Police Commands. Statistics from the Nigeria Police Force show "
"that between 2007 and 2012 most Police Commands were in charge of 2 to 3 "
"Police Area Commands (though some heavily populated states have more, with "
"Lagos having the most at 8). These statistics also show that on average each"
" state and the federal capital territory had 30 Police Divisions, which by "
"law are generally under the command of a Police Area Command. Thus, from a "
"few initial sources a Monitor researcher can have a general sense of the "
"structure of the police and a useful metric to compare the Monitor’s dataset"
" against."
